# Advent of Code 2024

Each day is a Rust package with a binary crate for each part, and a library crate for common code. To run a given day's solution,
e.g. day 1:

```
cd day_1
cargo run --bin part_1
cargo run --bin part_2
```

I try to include some tests for each day, even if it is just doctests for library functions. To run tests:

```
cd day_1
cargo test
```
